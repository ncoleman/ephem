Ephemeris is an online ephemeris program.  It takes a user's location and timezone and
calculates a range of ephemeris information for all planets and major moons in the Solar
System, and it can optionally display information for selected stars and messier
objects.

It can filter the output to remove clutter, and it can sort the display tables by
column.

It provides the ability for a user to save their information for later use, by storing
the data in cookies.

Ephemeris is a python CGI program that runs on any webserver that can handle CGI. It
uses the PyEphem module ( http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/ ) to provide the astronomical
calculations.  Apart from standard python modules, it also uses the Cookie and pytz
modules.

See the Changelog for TODO.
